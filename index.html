                    <h2 class="name">Horsback Riding</h2>
                    <p>The one thing my wife insisted that we do was go horseback riding. Let me start by mentioning that I grew up riding dirt bikes. The thing I liked about the dirt bikes was that I was in full control of what the bike did. My wife on the other hand grew up riding horses so she was already used to how to conrtol them and all that fun stuff. Needless to say I was a bit nervous hoping on a this horse much bigger than me that could brush me off its back whenever it felt the need! I was beyond nervous on the back of a horse, but I did the best I could. In the end it was totally worth it to see the joy it brought to my wife to enjoy a wonderful horseback ride on the beach!</p>

                    <h2>Scuba Diving</h2>
                    <p>Now this was my idea! My dad had scuba dived serveral times in his life, and mentioned how fun it always was! I knew as soon as I saw this as an option that we were going! This was the thing my wife was a little skeptical on.. considering one of her biggest fears is sharks! Luckily for the both of us we did NOT encounter any sharks on our scuba diving trip! After we took the hour saftey course we were off on a boat with a big group of people. This was by far one of my favorite things we did on the trip! Once my wife got used to the whole breathing under water thing (which is weird at first) she really enjoyed it as well! We both highly recommend that if you ever get the chance to go scuba diving you should 100% try it!</p>

                    <h2>Trip Around the Island</h2>
                    <p>We took a guided tour trip around the island that we both enjoyed! We started by loading up on a catamaran from the resort and made way towards the Capital city Castries! We spent most of the day running around and having the tour guide show us a lot of top tourist spots! We went up the "Stairway to Heaven" to get an incredible view of the Jade mountain. We took mud baths in the sulpher springs. The water was naturally heated by a volcano, and let me tell you it was HOT!! We were able to see a couple waterfalls and many other things that St. Lucia had to offer. We ended the day with a snorkling trip just outside the capitals harbor before we headed back to the resort!</p>

                    <h2>The Resort</h2>
                    <p>We loved everything about the resort we stayed at! The many food opions were all very good. Our favorite one was <b>Maria's</b>. Which was the best italian we have both ever had! There were many pools we could enjoy and of course the beach was right around the corner! One of our favoirte parts was the beach side couples massage that was beyond relaxing! If we ever go back to St. Lucia we would be very happy to go back to the resort we stayed at for our honeymoon!</p>
